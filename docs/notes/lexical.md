# Analysis Notes #

The first part of any interpreter or compiler is the analysis phase.  During this phase the source program is analyzed in order to construct efficient structures around it and to verify it's correctness.

## Lexical Analysis

The purpose of Lexical Analysis, in terms of compilers and interpreters, is to take in a source program and convert it into its basic components. 
These basic components are usually determined by the syntax of the language.  To describe the syntax of a language we use a notation called context-free grammars, or equivalently Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).
